# The Null Hypothesis {#null}

Okay, I'm so damn sick of hearing "you can't prove the null" I think I'll cry the next time I read it somewhere else. It often followed by something like "you can only fail to reject the null." While this is true in philosophy class, and *technically* True with a capital T in statistics...

We **can** prove the null **for all practical intents and purposes**. 

We just can. 

And we do. 

If we didn't, science would proceed at a much slower pace.
