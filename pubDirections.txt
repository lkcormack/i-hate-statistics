Note on publishing -
I FINALLY FIGURED A WORKFLOW TO BOOKDOWN!

Index should have this:
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
output: bookdown::gitbook

Build the book.

setwd() in to the ./_book folder

Make a manifest.json file (don't ask)
rsconnect::writeManifest(appPrimaryDoc = "index.html", contentCategory = "site")

Copy the folder and change its name to "LeBook" or something (_book is in my gitignore)

Push to GitHub.

Go to bookdown / content
hit import from git
paste the repo url
pick the "LeBook" folder

That should work!!!
