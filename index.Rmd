# Preface {-}

When I was first introduced to statistics-as-practiced-in-psychology in an Experimental Methods class at the University of Florida, I didn't really hate it, I just thought it was — well — stupid. I grew up around scientists — most of my father's friends were "hard" scientists, and I volunteered over summers in a field ion microscopy lab since the 5th grade — and I knew that scientists did **NOT** put their data in a magic box that produced a binary output of "significant" or "not significant". Fortunately, I worked as an RA in the lab of Keith White, and was from the tradition of plotting data and testing theories rather than "testing" data to see if they were "significant" or not. Keith suggested I take the two semester sequence in Mathematical Statistics rather than the normal statistics sequence out of Psychology, which I did. I rather enjoyed it; it was mostly proving theorems and emphasized the calculation of probabilities (as opposed to "critical values").

I truly learned to hate statistics during my gap year at Vanderbilt University. We did a simple experiment to test two competing theories, one predicted a positive relationship between two variables, while the other predicted no relationship. The data were very clean, and clearly showed no relationship, which pleased me because this is what I had predicted before the experiment. I showed a graduate student the results and they began saying blah blah blah you can't prove the null blah blah negative result blah blah. I said we weren't trying to "prove the null", but the data clearly supported one theory over the other. They said something like "your experiment didn't work, it's a negative result, it's just that simple." I asked "Then what about the Michelson-Morely experiment? That was a negative result." They thought about it a moment and said "That's an exception."
