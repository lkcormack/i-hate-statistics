This (under construction) project is a short book about everything wrong with the traditional way statistics was and is practiced. While the American Statistical Association and many psychologists are making a great effort to change things, the ways of old linger:

- obviously, there is a huge amount literature produced using them
- many (most?) researchers in psychology and other fields still use them
- every student I've ever had that has either taken statistics in high school or taken it at another college or university has been indoctrinated into them

This book is being written using R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
